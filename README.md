This repository contains a collection of scripts relating to data munging and exploratory data analysis of hockey statistics. Currently, only NHL stats are covered here. Other leagues and modeling scripts are forthcoming. Plots may also soon appear here.

### Kaggle Titanic

After completing the Datacamp tutorial with the Titanic survivors dataset, I thought I would like to try to improve on the performance of the tutorial scripts with some attempts of my own.
